# Following and unfollowing groups

## Following Groups

Given that I am on the Edit Group page

When I click on "Follow"

Then the system responds "You were added as a follower of Avery."

And the group is listed under "My Groups" on the group management page

#/##

## Unfollowing Groups

Given that I am on the group edit page

When I click on "Unfollow"

Then the system responds, "You were removed as a follower of Avery."

And the group is removed from the "My Groups" section on the group management page

#/##
